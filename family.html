    <h1>My Family</h1>
<p>I come from a family of five in the small town of Bowdoin, Maine. </p>
<p>My family consists of my Mom, Dad, younger sister, and younger brother.</p>
<p>My siblings and I are pretty close but the age different can be a little difficult with my brother being 8 years younger than me.</p>
<div>My family may seem the average size, but once outside of my household my family is huge.</div>
