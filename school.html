    <h1>Academic Progress</h1>
	<p>I graduated from Mt. Ararat High School in Topsham, Maine in 2017. I am currently a second year student here at Umaine. Business Finance is a new major to me this semester as I have just recently switched from Mechanical Engineering. I have not yet taken any Finance specific classes but I am enjoying my new Business Finance major.</p>
